niknamH: @NickyAACampbell So PM to breakup Chinatown & orthodox Jewish areas in London?Also strange how EDL never demo there but only in Muslim areas

DonaldHTaylor: Cameron's lecture to UK Muslims today as the EDL marches is a deliberate and sad choice by a British PM http://j.mp/dV6cjh

themsley: I think we should let the EDL be allowed to protest, as long as it doesn't turn violent. Freedom of assembly is an important right. #luton

letdemeatcake: Thanks Cameron for your strong message of support to the EDL - your comments will isolate all moderate Muslims

juliefa2: Wonderful timing for Cameron to attack multiculturalism on the very day that EDL scum are congregating in Luton. Fucking sigh.

Pullmyfinger82: EDL represent the scary side of english culture any excuses to get drunk and hate everyone who isn't English or Christian...

ShellyAsquith: #EDL leader says Cameron is 'saying what we're saying' re multiculturalism and Islam. That's pretty scray.

such_heights: So glad Cameron is attacking British Muslims on a day when the EDL are marching in Luton. >:(

moridura: David Cameron's statement on multiculturalism at the same time as the EDL rally in Luton is inflammatory, and I believe it was meant to be.
