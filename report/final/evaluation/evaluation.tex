% Be warned that many projects fall down through poor evaluation. Simply building a system and documenting its design and functionality is not enough to gain top marks. It is extremely important that you evaluate what you have done both in absolute terms and in comparison with existing techniques, software, hardware etc. This might involve quantitative evaluation, for example based on numerical results, performance etc. or something more qualitative such as expressibility, functionality, ease-of-use etc. At some point you should also evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of what you have done. Avoid statements like "The project has been a complete success and we have solved all the problems asssociated with blah...; - you will be shot down immediately! It is important to understand that there is no such thing as a perfect project. Even the very best pieces of work have their limitations and you are expected to provide a proper critical appraisal of what you have done.
