% This is one of the most important components of the report. It should begin with a clear statement of what the project is about so that the nature and scope of the project can be understood by a lay reader. It should summarise everything you set out to achieve, provide a clear summary of the project's background, relevance and main contributions. It should explain the motivation for the project (i.e., why the problem is important) and identify the issues to be addressed (i.e., why the problem is difficult). The introduction should set the scene for the project and should provide the reader with a summary of the key things to look out for in the remainder of the report. When detailing the contributions it is helpful to provide pointers to the section(s) of the report that provide the relevant technical details. The introduction itself should be largely non-technical. It is sometimes useful to state the main objectives of the project as part of the introduction. However, avoid the temptation to list low-level objectives one after another in the introduction and then later, in the evaluation section (see below), say something like "All the objectives of the project have been met blah blah...". A project that meets all its objectives is, by definition, weak and unambitious. Concentrate instead on the big issues, e.g. the main questions (scientific or otherwise) that the project sets out to answer.

\chapter{Introduction}

% The ability to listen to and understand public opinion serves as the foundation upon which democratic society is built. Although the merits of different electoral systems can be debated, in general they all provide effective and functional methods for democratically electing governments. 

\section{Motivation}

From women's rights to civil rights, the influence of public opinion on government policy has been pivotal. Within a healthy democracy the voice of the electorate should be heard and recognised by those chosen to represent them. Throughout history platforms have often been provided for public opinion to be made known, from the early public forums of Greece and Rome, to speaker's corner and the house of commons today. Providing a means for people to express their opinion enables them to both challenge and shape the direction their elected governments take. As a result, finding ways of gathering and understanding this opinion has increasingly proven fundamental if a government wishes to be successful.

Current methods of measuring opinion are largely statistical, with methods such as polling looking at the opinion of a sample group, before using their results to make further predictions. These can be informative, however their small sampling rates mean that figures can often be askew. Furthermore polling is both costly and time consuming to conduct, and thus can neither be used to find opinion on breaking news or across a large number of topics. None the less, as methods for measuring public opinion have improved both in accuracy and detail, politicians and policy makers have increasingly turned to them not only for affirmation of their policies, but for guidance and new initiative.

As the web has become more prevalent throughout society, it is increasingly becoming a platform for discussion and opinion. The initial growth of blogging demonstrated the web's ability to serve as a forum for debate and opinion. However the technical knowledge required to start a blog, alongside the time required to write a post meant that adoption was limited. In the past two years we have seen the rise of micro-blogging (essentially 140 character blog posts) through services such as Twitter. These have seen unprecedented levels of adoption, with Twitter's 200 million users posting 25 billion micro-blog posts in 2010. Due to the simple nature of writing short posts, micro-blog discussion tends to break quickly around news topics, and offers genuine insight into public opinion surrounding news topics.

This project hopes to utilise the growth of publicly available opinion on the web, using it as a source upon which new methods for analysing and measuring public opinion can be built. In particular the project will focus on understanding sentiment on micro-blogging services such as Twitter. 

\section{Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Ruby implementation of a sentiment analysis engine based upon current research. The engine should be able to correctly identify sentences containing sentiment, and classify the sentiment as positive or negative. Different implementations should be tested and compared to determine which algorithms and techniques work best.

\item An algorithm for classifying sentiment as a range of emotion and feeling, rather than just a score along a scale of positive to negative. The algorithm should be implemented in Ruby and included in the sentiment analysis engine.

\item Research optimisations for current algorithms, in order to tailor the sentiment analysis engine for micro-blog posts from services such as Twitter. These optimisation should be implemented within the engine.

\item Research optimisations for current algorithms, in order to better facilitate the understanding of Politically focussed micro-blog data. These optimisation should be implemented within the engine.

\item A Ruby based Twitter module to store and classify live data from Twitter. 

\item Visualisations should be designed and implemented to help better understand the data and classification results.
