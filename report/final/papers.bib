abstract = {Recently, a huge wave of social media has generated significant impact in people's perceptions about technological domains. They are captured in several blogs/forums, where the themes relate to products of several companies. One of the companies can be interested to track them as resources for customer perceptions and detect user sentiments. The keyword-based approaches for identifying such themes fail to give satisfactory level of accuracy. Here, we address the above problems using statistical text-mining of blog entries. The crux of the analysis lies in mining quantitative information from textual entries. Once the relevant blog entries for the company/its competitors are filtered out, the theme identification is performed using a highly accurate novel technique termed as 'Best Separators Algorithm'. Logistic regression coupled with dimension reduction technique (singular value decomposition) is used to identify the tonality of those blogs. The final analysis shows significant improvement in terms of accuracy over popular approaches.},

Many new and exciting social, geopolitical, and business-related research questions can be answered by analyzing the thousands, even millions, of comments and responses expressed in various blogs (such as the blogosphere), forums (such as Yahoo Forums), social media and social network sites (including YouTube, Facebook, and Flikr), virtual worlds (such as Second Life), and tweets (Twitter). Opinion mining, a subdiscipline within data mining and computational linguistics, refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classifying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in various online news sources, social media comments, and other user-generated content. Sentiment analysis is often used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjectivity, and other emotional states in online text.},

abstract = {Recommendation algorithms are best known for their use on e-commerce Web sites, where they use input about a customer's interests to generate a list of recommended items. Many applications use only the items that customers purchase and explicitly rate to represent their interests, but they can also use other attributes, including items viewed, demographic data, subject interests, and favorite artists. At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog. Our algorithm produces recommendations in real-time, scales to massive data sets, and generates high quality recommendations.},
