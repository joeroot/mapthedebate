\chapter*{abstract}

	In a day and age where public opinion dictates so much within politics and business, finding better ways to understand and harness it are proving increasingly fundamental. This project will look at how we can use today's online forums of debate such as Twitter, as as source for more accurate methods of understanding public emotion and sentiment. 
	
	In doing so we will explore techniques from Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, along with the more specific emerging field of Sentiment Analysis. We will look at ways of both identifying opinion and classifying its polarity. Whilst doing this, we shall look at the limitations of common methods within the field, along with identifying potential improvements and adaptations to them. Finally we shall look at how using Twitter as a domain will impact our approach to sentiment analysis, along with how its problems, and thus methods, must change as a result of Twitter's constraints and peculiarities.
	
	Lastly, we shall look at how we can best draw our work together in order to make it available for others to use and understand. We will explore in which it can be made easily accessible to developers, along with methods for presenting it in an intuitive and understandable manner to others.
