\chapter*{acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my parents, girlfriend Elizabth, Tim (sorry!) and Catherine for all their support over the past few months. I can't tell you how much of a difference each one of you has made. I'd like to thank Susan Eisenbach for her continual advice, support and open door over the past three years. Thanks also to my second marker, Iian Phillips, for his willingness to help and general input to the project. 
	
Lastly, I would like to thank my supervisor Francesca Toni. Your insightful input, enthusiasm and encouragement have kept me going on the numerous occasions I've felt like giving up. Thank you for taking on my project, its (sp?) genuinely been a pleasure!
