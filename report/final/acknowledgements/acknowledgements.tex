	I would like to thank my parents, girlfriend, Tim (sorry!) and Catherine for all their support over the past few months. I can't tell you how much of a difference each one of you has made. It's meant everything to me and I wish I was penning your names to a better project! I'd like to thank Susan for her continual advice, support and open door over the past three years. I couldn't imagine Imperial without you! Thanks also to my second marker Iian for his advice and input. Lastly I'd like to thank my supervisor Francesca. Your cheerful enthusiasm and encouragement has kept me going on the numerous occasions I've felt like giving up. I couldn't have asked for a better supervisor and its (sp?) genuinely been a pleasure.
